This last week I have made 4 separate purchases in store each for over $100 and I have not received any coupons? Furthermore I made several large purchases in store in September and again no coupons? Why? Thankyou Geoff

I just want to follow up about my super delayed order which accidentally sent to pago pago american samoa. Someone email me back about my inquiry days ago and told me he will contact USPS abt my order and will email me in 2 days but its been several days now and i havent receive any update from you guys about my order. Its been 2 weeks now and i havent receive my order. Please im so desperate about whats happening with my order. This is my first time ordering in uniqlo but its been so disappointing that you sent it in American Samoa instead here in Saipan. Pls sir/madam kindly do something about it or if you can sent it to me asap just refund my money. Thanks and have a nice day. JOSE ROBERTO AGUILAR

Please cancel immediately and confirm in writing. Thanks and regards Flavia

I read this article: https://www.permanentstyle.com/2020/02/best-value-product-uniqlo-or-what-you-get-for-your-money.html and it suggested that you might be treating your Merino wool sweaters with chemicals to give them a certain feel. See quote from that article below Can you confirm whether you treat your wool sweaters with chemicals or not? thanks kindly, Alex "Two of the experts pointed this out immediately. They said I should try rubbing the piece with my fingers, and then rub the fingers together. They felt oily. Or perhaps not oily - more smooth, like moisturiser. They said this was the chemical finishing that had been put on the garment, to make it feel softer. Uniqlo also says it puts finishing on the garments to stop them pilling, so this might be part of the same treatment. "
I received my Uniqlo order today, but one of the turtlenecks I ordered was not there. I need a refund for this turtleneck or for it to be immediately shipped. Best, Jeff
Good morning, I still have not received a refund from a package I delivered on January 16th. My tracking number is 9202 3946 5304 7027 2010 84 The item I should be receiving a refund for is the “FLUFFY YARN FLEECE FULL-ZIP JACKET” Warm regards, Nicole
For additional context, I've already purchased a replacement in-store after speaking with the customer service rep on the phone. Thanks!

Hello. I order two items a few days ago. It was supposed to be delivered today but when I looked at the tracking, it says it is still in prep mode. How will I know when to expect it. My order # is UNU12361885 Thank you, Sydney
Hello, My order: UNU12158744 The order was delivered at my PO Box (Postal Annex in Redwood Shores, California). The tracking with FedEx shows that it was delivered but the 2 people who worked at Postal Annex said they do not have the package. They ask me if you have a copy of the label so they could scan it in their system and see what's going on. Please advise on what to do. Geoffroy

Uniqlo, You lied about your refer a friend program. It didn’t work. I don’t ever want an email from you again nor will I shop at your stores. Brian Heimbecker
Hi, Due to some emergencies, I will no longer live in Cleveland. The tracking info shows the delivery date is Feb. 5, which is the date that I am leaving so that I cannot receive that package anymore. Can you change my shipping address to 3016 Almond Rd Ames, IA 50014? My order number is UNU12323547 . Thanks, Jingfang Li
