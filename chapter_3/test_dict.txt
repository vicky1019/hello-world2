This last week I have made 4 separate purchases in store each for over $100 and I have not received any coupons? Furthermore I made several large purchases in store in September and again no coupons? Why? Thankyou Geoff

Good morning, This past week I’ve placed 2 separate orders trying to get the WOMEN STRETCH PILE-LINED FLEECE in black or blue for my mother. Both times the orders were canceled which was very disappointing. Could you help me with this? I’d like to order one for her. Thank you, Jessica
